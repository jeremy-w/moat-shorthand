## Preface
p2: Psh, I can do better than Byrom. I’ll just glue all the good bits together.

p3: _Obviously_ everyone will learn the perfect shorthand. So clearly we just need to nail it and wait for the adulation to roll in.

p5: Throw some Euclid in, no-one can argue with that.

p6: Perfect means brief/simple (alphabet), perspicuous (distinct characters), facile (easy bigram joins), no arbitrary symbols. That whole “simple alphabet” thing trounces everyone.

p7: How has no-one given clear angle guidelines for everything? It’s like you people don’t even use your compass and ruler when writing shorthand or something. So yeah, our alphabet is better, and it’s got Science™️ and Precision. Irresistible.

p8: Man I love rulers. Chuck some lines at it. Boom! Vowels! Perfectly clear implication without ever writing a one of them. And somehow knowing they both have an A vowel first makes “afar” and “far”, or should I say, A:FR and A:FR, 100% distinct. Just trust me on that.

Like, look what these disemvoweled systems do to a classic Our Father. Just, trash. Throw some first vowels in! It’s soooo much better!

Moat: It’s Got Vowels

p9: Just think of all that time you spend created ruled paper as pregaming your dictation. What a lead you’ll have right out the gate! Definitely not boring grunt work you’ll pawn off on an apprentice or something.

You know those like 3 examples in the Gurney manual of like “I have been” and “she would have”? I have this amazing system where you can build like 15,000 of em with just 8 signs. And unlike all the other systems, you won’t be made to guess if it’s one of these conglomerations, or just an abbreviated word. Lemme introduce you to my friend, the circulating pronoun dot.

I also do suffixes better. Just build all this awesome out of my killer alphabet. It’s why I’m an _inventor._ And, uh, I hope it’s better than what came before, but, you tell me!

p10: We’ll actually tell you whose stuff we used, unless it’s just general practice. We’re all just buds perfecting shorthand together.

Now I’m here with the receipts for that “one third less inflections of the pen” thanks to Psalm 1. See, Moat is _mathematically better._ (Euclid would agree.)

p11: And don’t forget to count pen lifts. They’re just pwned. (I’m not counting dots in the delta, because I use more, but feel free to use the table on the other page to do your own math. I recommend using a ruler to extend the table lines first. It will be truly satisfying.)

Also, lol, Dr Rees chose THE WORST shorthand for his Encyclopedia. Loser.

But let history be the judge of whether Moat is best. (But don’t forget: math!)
