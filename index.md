In 1833, Thomas Moat finally had enough cash to pay someone to print his hobby shorthand project. He believed he had invented the future of shorthand. He was dead wrong.

But his manual is so dang full of itself, and his system looks so wild on the page, that it’s entertaining to read through. Like watching a train crash.

This site collects a snarky paraphrase of his manual.

Sit down, grab something strong, and prepare to drink every time Moat talks about perspicuity. We’re going on a ride through [Moat’s _Shorthand Standard_ (PDF)](https://books.google.ie/books?id=2GwCAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP9&source=kp_read_button&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&gboemv=1&ovdme=1&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false), or should I say, 
_The_  
SHORT-HAND STANDARD  
attempted  
_by an analysis of the Circle_  
_as an introductory foundation_  
OF A  
**New System of Stenography**  
which demonstratively proves  
_that a Speaker can be followed_  
with one-third less inflexions of the Pen,  
AND CONSEQUENTLY  
**in one-third less time**  
_than by_  
**ANY OTHER SYSTEM EXTANT.**
